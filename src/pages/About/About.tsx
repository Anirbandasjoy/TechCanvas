          My journey to learn programming began. My diploma is from first
          semester of engineering life. I had very little understanding of
          programming at first. In the first semester when I was studying very
          much in theory base, I learned from my friends elder brothers that if
          the students of computer science do not have skills, they will not be
          able to do anything in life. Since then I slowly started learning
          programming from YouTube after hearing from my elder brothers. Then I
          follow many playlists like Anisul Islam, Sumit Saha. Then complete my
          Programming Hero Level 1 web development course. This was my journey
          to start programming in short.
